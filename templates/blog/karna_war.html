                    <p><span class="firstcharacter">K</span>arna, the son of Surya, an unsung hero, a fallen warrior, is undoubtedly a story of sacrifice and heroics wrapped with its own follies and regrets, molding him into one of the greatest lives ever lived (perceive every fictional, historical or mythological character as real, for just because a realm exists in your mind doesn’t make it a lie). It wouldn’t be wrong to say he was one of the first antiheroes ever created.</p>
                    <p>If not aware of his story, I have briefly recapped** it at the footnote so that the article stays true to its comprehensibility. Nonetheless, this article is mainly meant to highlight Karna as a teacher, who taught everyone to stay strong and true to one’s own soul despite innumerable hurdles which might come your way and question the moral dilemmas along. I decided to write this as I could see so many battles being sparked today. Hence maybe taking inspirations from such characters would prove to be the light at the end of this very dark tunnel.</p>

                    <h3>Karna: A Battle Within!</h3>
                    <p>Mahabharata mainly underlines the concept of dharma, that is, righteousness. It is said to be the greatest war ever fought in the entirety of the Indian history wherein Lord Vishnu himself dawned upon this mortal earth in the form of his human embodiment, Lord Krishna, in order to establish Dharma. Every character sketched, good or bad, has his own journey which contributes to this establishment. The best part of this epic is that no character is completely true to the humane comprehension of right and wrong. They have their own strengths and weaknesses. And Karna is the most pivotal in this dilemma of being a hero or a villain. You’ll always find people argue over this fact yet for me he is the most heroic human character ever written. Yes, he had his faults, he did fall off towards the wrongness of the moral sense, he could be a very powerful antagonist if one sees through that lens but isn’t this the reason why he comes out to be the protagonist instead? Because, these flaws makes him human. Though he was half God yet the moral contradictions and the subsequent regrets makes him as human as humanely possible.</p>
                    <p>Karna was fueled with anger. He was humiliated time and again which instilled in him a great agony. When drowning in one such pool of ignominy, he was saved by Duryodhan which paved the way for a friendship which is extremely rare and beautiful. Unknown to the various implications time would create upon his life, he pledged his alliance to this friend which he then fulfilled by giving up his life. It is absolutely poignant to highlight the importance of such an alliance especially when our times are so laced with hypocrisy. The irascible tendencies being formed through various technological advancements need to know how extremely significant it is to remain true to one’s own heart even when submerged with the greatest of political and personal dilemmas.</p>
                    <p>Imagine for an instance, you’ve been working really hard to prove yourself. Imagine, being bullied in school and refrained from opportunities, you’ve been trying really hard to strive towards a goal which would end all your sufferings and establish you as a warrior. Now imagine, all of a sudden, one day you win that treasure, your pedestal, through a simple coincidence, but winning that would mean betraying your only friend who has been there for you all through your difficult times. Even though you are aware that your friend is not a good person, even though you know he befriended you because of his own selfish reasons and even though you know staying back would mean the death of you, will you choose to claim that throne or stay and die for your friend? This is a very difficult choice, not even including the personal implications of going against your own brothers. Honestly speaking, most of us would choose the treasure though we might answer this otherwise in order to balance our ethical grounds. There could be many ways to console ourselves over our choice.</p>
                    <p>Karna could have done that as well. He could have easily said that he did this in order to avoid the war. He could have been the king and even married Draupadi as a Pandav. His brothers would have accepted it, his mother would have atoned through this, and even Duryodhan might have swayed given the strong friendship they enjoyed. He could have avoided the war and all the bloodshed which followed but would he have been able to avoid the war thus brewed within his moral conscience? Would the world have remembered him the way it does now? Would he have got this title of the unsung hero if he swayed sides? And would I be writing this at all if he was the one who claimed the throne?</p>
                    <p>All these questions are prevalent but doesn’t this in some twisted way also prove that Karna was a selfish person who in order to remain true to his personal conscious decided to let lose the war when he could have saved so many warriors by sacrificing his soul.</p>
                    <h5>'’दया कर शत्रु को भी त्राण देकर ,
                        खुशी से मित्रता पर प्राण देकर ,
                        गया है कर्ण भू को दीन करके ,
                        मनुज-कुल को बहुत बलहीन करके .’'</h5>
                    <p>**Karna is one of the major characters in the Hindu epic Mahabharat. He is the son of Lord Surya (that is Sun) and princess Kunti who was conceived while Kunti was a maiden. Scared by the various orthodox blemishes of the society, Kunti decided to abandon her son, in turn valuing her own prestige more than the life of her newborn. Thus abandoned, Karna was adopted by a charioteer Adhirath and his wife Radha. Since, caste system was very prevalent in ancient India, Karna was denied every right that paralleled his talents and yet he came off as one the greatest archers of all times. Unknown to his own parentage, Karna befriended Duryodhana, arch-enemy of his half-brothers (the Pandavas). In his own war to claim victory over every right denied to him, he was blinded by anger and envy. Just before the war, Krishna (incarnation of Lord Vishnu) did tell him the truth and asked him to return to Kunti as the eldest Pandava and hence claim the throne. But true to his promise he refused to change sides at the last moment but did agree to kill no Pandavas except Arjun. Aware of the doom, he fought and lost the battle, making Arjun unknowingly commit fratricide.
                        This is a very crisp outline of what happened in the epic. To fathom the real character reading the epic is highly recommended.
